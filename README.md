# MessageFrenzy

### A Python application that generates new sentences based off of previous.

#### Introduction
The application follows a concept that was constructed by Andrey Markov who wanted to identify future values based off of previous. In our everyday lives we see the use of Markov Chains and we dont even realize it. Anything from Siri to Google Maps use Markov Chains. 

#### What it does
With MessageFrenzy, users will be able to enter some context which is a string. Then the algorithm breaks down the conext and builds a markov chain which is then used to genrate new sentences based off of the context. Clone it and try it out!
